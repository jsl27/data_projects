## Timeline Visualization

This ggplot visualization — using artifical Airbnb data for data privacy reasons — shows requested trip nights in guest-to-host contacts. Unlike a simple histogram of requested nights, these jittered lines are able to both maintain visual representation of individual trips, as well as illustrate high-demand nights.
