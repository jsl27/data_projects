## Data Journalism Selected Clips

Two of my favorite data-journalism bylines from my time as a staff reporter & data journalist for TIME Magazine/TIME.com.

### [The Real Problem With Asian-American Diversity in the Workforce](http://time.com/3475962/asian-american-diversity/)

This October 2014 [article](http://time.com/3475962/asian-american-diversity/) argued that technology companies' diversity reports ignored clear data-driven evidence of bias against Asian Americans for leadership roles.

It was one of TIME's most-read articles of the year, one of the reasons being my resurfacing and open criticism of TIME's own role in building racism against Asian Americans: TIME's infamous 1987 cover, known by historians for its racist caricature of Asian Americans, was a key player in spreading the "model minority myth."

This work generated numerous responses in national media, and it was named to [Gawker's "Best Things We Read in 2014"](http://review.gawker.com/the-best-things-we-read-in-2014-1670504393). Since then, it has been cited in dozens of published academic papers and history books.



### [Ebola Healthcare Workers Are Dying Faster Than Their Patients](http://time.com/3475962/asian-american-diversity/)

This October 2014 [article](http://time.com/3453429/ebola-healthcare-workers-fatality-rate/) was a deep-dive into the ostensibly statistically-significant difference between doctor and patient Ebola fatality rates during the 2014 West African Ebola crisis. 

Analyzing publicly-available Ebola data and interviewing several doctors, patients and healthcare officals, I was the first to report on how the most accurate Ebola fatality data may be found by looking to doctors' own medical records. My reporting was part of the lead-up and TIME's internal editorial discussions regarding [TIME Magazine's 2014 Person of the Year](http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-ebola-fighters-choice/), the Ebola Fighters.
